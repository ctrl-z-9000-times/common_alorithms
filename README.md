Common Graph Algorithms Library

This is a library of common graph algorithms with a functional API so that it 
can directly work with arbitrary python data structures.

Currently Implemented:
- depth_first_traversal()       A lazy depth first traversal
- depth_first_search()          A depth first search



In the future I would like to implement more graph algorithms:
- Topological Sort
- Connected Components
- Strongly Connected Components
- Iterative Deepening Depth First Search
- Breadth First Traversal
- Breadth First Search
- Bidirectional search (BSF run from start and end simultaneously)
- A*
- Memory Bounded A*
- Min-cut/Max-flow
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Substructure Search
